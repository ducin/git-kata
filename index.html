            adventures with Android and C++. I have written my own domain specific
            language with antlr3. Some time ago I have started using git. At the

            which I found being very useful.

            </a>
            <br/>
            I started as a Java developer around 6 years ago. I was working mostly in <a href="http://javart.eu">Javart</a>,
            on the server side, where I introduced new workflow with code-review based on git and
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">Gerrit</a>.
            In the meantime, first Android device has appeared in my pocket.
            Step by step I eventually moved to the mobile world
            and have joined <a href="http://polidea.pl">Polidea</a> team recently.
            <br/>Git followed me. No other tool has made such a difference to me as git towards svn.
            I love its simplicity, speed and technology agnosticism!

            <br/><br/>Favourite git command:
            <pre><code>$ git rerere</code></pre>

        </p>
